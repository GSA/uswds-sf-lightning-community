# Welcome

We're so glad you're thinking about contributing to a U.S. Government open source project! If you're unsure about anything, just ask -- or submit the issue or pull request anyway. The worst that can happen is you'll be politely asked to change something. We love all friendly contributions.

## Issue Guidelines

In the interest of making it easier for our contributors to manage site issues, we request that issues follow certain guidelines. Our developers mainly use [issues](/issues) to identify and prioritize their work. If you have questions about the theme or would like start a general discussion, we kindly request that you email us at [gsalabs@gsa.gov](mailto://gsalabs@gsa.gov). Our issue guidelines are a living document and a work in progress, so feel free to offer feedback on it, by emailing us at [gsalabs@gsa.gov](mailto://gsalabs@gsa.gov)

- **Specific**: The issue makes specific requests. An example of a specific request would be `Reduce the Size of Images`. An example of a non-specific request would be `Improve Site Performance`.
- **Measurable**: The issue has specific requirements and can be closed when those requirements are met. This helps us track the progress in addressing problems. For example, tech debt is always something to work on, so we should create separate issues for this, such as `Consolidate Styling of Repo and Task Cards` and `Convert Validator from Monaco Editor to jsoneditor`, rather than `Address Tech Debt`.
- **Actionable**: An issue should request a specific action from a member of the code.gov team or community. An example of something actionable would be `Remove Debugging Text from Loading Screen`. An example of something that isn't actionable by our team or community is `My city should be forking Code.gov`.
- **Realistic**: The issue is something that is achievable by the resources of the project, including contributions from the open source community. An example of a realistic issue is `Include Line Numbers in Validator`.
- **Time-Aware**: The issue is something that can be resolved within 6 months. If you think your issue might take longer, we encourage you to break up your issues into smaller issues (like stepping stones) that we can address. We can still work on big problems, but it is easier for us to track progress and identify what we need to work on, when big problems are broken up into smaller ones.

## Code Guidelines

We use Prettier as the default formatter for our code. This ensures a consistent product across all files an enhances readability. More information about Prettier can be found at [https://prettier.io/](https://prettier.io/).

When creating a new feature, one should think about the broad variety of uses for a given component and design it in such a way that the end user can adjust via Experience Builder as needed. If making changes to the theme itself, `uswdsTheme`, provide the ability to toggle a component on/off or have it collapse down to zero height if not in use.

## Establishing a Development Environment

Using Salesforce [Scratch Orgs](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.managing_scratch_orgs.htm&type=5) is the easiest way to get up and running with the repository. See [INSTALLATION](INSTALLATION.md#sfdx-instructions) for specific instructions to deploy this code base to a fresh environment with SFDX.

## Creating a new Component

`sfdx force:lightning:component:create -d src/aura -n {component name}`

## Testing

Lightning Testing Service is used to run automated Jasmine tests against each component. Tests are captured in the `test/staticresources` directory and named using the following pattern, `uswds_lts_{component name}`.

### Testing Principles

Tests should follow the [Arrange, Act, Assert](https://integralpath.blogs.com/thinkingoutloud/2005/09/principles_of_t.html) principle. As a result, muliple assertions may be present in a given test. For example, the following contains two assertions (`expect()`) within a single test so as to verify all relevant text is present.

```javascript
describe("USA Banner", function () {
  it("Displays default banner text", function (done) {
    $T.createComponent("c:uswdsUSABanner", {}, true).then(function (component) {
      expect(
        document.getElementsByClassName("usa-banner__header-text")[0]
          .textContent
      ).toContain("An official website of the United States government");
      expect(
        document.getElementsByClassName("usa-banner__header-action")[0]
          .textContent
      ).toContain("Hereâ€™s how you know");
    });
  });
});
```

### Creating New Tests

Test `describe` and `it` statements should read as sentences so as to be readily consumed by a developer or site manager.

If creating a new component, a brand new static resource needs to be created. SFDX provides a shortcut,

`sfdx force:lightning:test:create -d test/staticresources -n uswds_lts_{component name}`

Once the test has been created, it should be referenced in `test/aura/jasmineTests/jasmineTests.app`.

Additionally, the new staticresource should be added to package.xml which can be taken care of by the following sfdx command. This command also supports the removal of files.

`sfdx force:source:manifest:create --sourcepath test --manifestname test/package.xml`

### Deploying Tests

`sfdx force:mdapi:deploy -d test/ -w 50 -u {username}`

### Running Tests

At this time, running tests directly in the terminal does not work. The issue is tracked in GitHub at [#108](https://github.com/GSA/uswds-sf-lightning-community/issues/108). Instead, output of the tests can be seen in the org at {orgURL}/c/jasmineTests.app. With SFDX, you can go straight there by entering the following into your terminal.

`sfdx force:org:open -p /c/jasmineTests.app -u {username}`
