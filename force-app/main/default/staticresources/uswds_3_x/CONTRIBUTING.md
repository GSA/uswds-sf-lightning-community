## How you can contribute

### Getting Started

Anyone can contribute to USWDS. Whether it's submitting a bug or proposing a new component, we welcome your ideas on how to improve the Design System.

First time contributor? We‚Äôre here to help guide you through a successful contribution. We review all contributions before merging them into USWDS. If you‚Äôre unsure about anything, just [ask](mailto:uswds@gsa.gov) ‚Äî or submit your issue or pull request anyway to get the conversation started.

Before submitting a contribution, you‚Äôll just need to create a GitHub account or sign in to your existing account.  

If you want to see some other contributions before submitting your own, check out [some good first issues](https://github.com/uswds/uswds/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Good+First+Issue%22) from other community members. Again, if you‚Äôve got questions, don‚Äôt hesitate to [reach out to us](mailto:uswds@gsa.gov). 


###  Submitting bugs and issues

If something isn‚Äôt working the way it's supposed to, here‚Äôs how you can let us know: 

#### 1. Check the issues backlog to see if your bug has already been reported

First, check our [current issues backlog](https://github.com/uswds/uswds/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Type%3A+Bug%22+) to see if your bug has already been reported. 

If your bug has already been reported, leave a comment in the original issue and provide any additional context (if different than the original submission). This helps us better understand the issue and its impact.

#### 2. Document how to reproduce the bug

Before submitting a bug, try to recreate it and document the steps we can take to reproduce it. If you can, take screen shots to capture specific details about the bug. This helps us understand its context. We can only fix bugs that we're able to understand and reproduce.

#### 3. Submit an issue

If your bug or issue is not in the [current issues backlog](https://github.com/uswds/uswds/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Type%3A+Bug%22+), submit an issue using the [bug report template](https://github.com/uswds/uswds/issues/new?assignees=&labels=Type%3A+Bug%2CStatus%3A+Triage%2CNeeds%3A+Confirmation&template=bug_report.yaml&title=USWDS+-+Bug%3A+%5BYOUR+TITLE%5D). A USWDS core team member may reach out to you if we need further clarification or context. We may also need your help testing possible solutions. Be sure to check in on your issue to answer any questions we may have about it.  

If you have a code fix for the issue, go ahead and submit a pull request. Our team tracks issues, so make sure any pull request you submit has a related issue.


### Proposing feature requests or enhancements

If you‚Äôve got a new idea or a suggestion for how something could work better, we want to hear about it. Here are a few steps to help you submit a feature request or enhancement. 

#### 1. Check the backlog of current feature requests 

Check our [feature requests backlog](https://github.com/uswds/uswds/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Type%3A+Feature+Request%22) for any duplicate or similar feature requests. 

If your idea has already been suggested, upvote that feature request with a thumbs up emoji (üëç) and comment on the issue to let us know why you need this feature request and any other supporting information. We review the number of upvotes (represented by üëç) to help us prioritize feature requests. 

If you want to find other feature requests open for upvoting, check out our [feature request view sorted by status](https://github.com/orgs/uswds/projects/8/views/18?sortedBy%5Bdirection%5D=asc&sortedBy%5BcolumnId%5D=Status). 

#### 2. Submit an issue

If your idea is not in the [current issues backlog](https://github.com/uswds/uswds/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Type%3A+Feature+Request%22), submit an issue using the [feature request template](https://github.com/uswds/uswds/issues/new?assignees=&labels=Type%3A+Feature+Request%2CStatus%3A+Triage&template=feature_request.yaml&title=USWDS+-+Feature%3A+%5BYOUR+TITLE%5D).  A USWDS core team member may reach out to you if we need further clarification on your submission. 


### Submitting pull requests

If you want to propose a code fix, even better! Here‚Äôs a few steps to help you submit pull requests.

#### If it‚Äôs a bug fix:

1. Check our [open issues backlog](https://github.com/uswds/uswds/issues) for any duplicate or similar issues. 
2. If your bug has already been submitted, feel free to comment and provide additional context (if different than the original submission).  
3. If your proposed fix is not in the open issues backlog, create an [issue](https://github.com/uswds/uswds/issues/new/choose) for the change you‚Äôre proposing.  This helps us track our work. 
4. Fork this repo into your GitHub account. Read more about forking a repo on [GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/). 
5. Create a branch from `develop` and name it in a way that lightly defines what you‚Äôre working on (for example, `add-styles`).
7. Once you‚Äôre ready to submit a pull request, fill out the [pull request template](https://github.com/uswds/uswds/compare).
8. Link your pull request to the issue you created. This important step helps us know which issue this solution fixes. Tip: You can link the pull request in the body of the pull request template using the GitHub comment `closes #issue-no` or `resolves #issue-no`. You can read more about linking pull requests on [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue).
9. Submit your pull request against the `develop` branch. 

If the pull request is accepted, we will schedule the issue and merge the pull request for you. 

#### If it's a feature request or enhancement:

1. Check our [open issues backlog](https://github.com/uswds/uswds/issues) for any duplicate or similar issues.
2. If your idea has already been suggested, upvote that feature request with a thumbs up emoji (üëç) and comment on the issue to let us know why you need this feature request or enhancement and any other supporting information. 
Tip: If you want to find other feature requests open for upvoting, check out our [feature requests sorted by upvotes](https://github.com/uswds/uswds/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Status%3A+Voting+Open+%F0%9F%91%8D%22+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc). 
3. If your proposed fix is not in the [open issues backlog](https://github.com/uswds/uswds/issues), [create an issue](https://github.com/uswds/uswds/issues/new?assignees=&labels=Type%3A+Feature+Request%2CStatus%3A+Triage&template=feature_request.yaml&title=USWDS+-+Feature%3A+%5BYOUR+TITLE%5D) describing your proposal. This doesn‚Äôt mean we don‚Äôt want you to create a pull request. We simply want to start the process with an online conversation first. Plus, other community members might have supporting thoughts to add to your proposal. If you‚Äôve already got a pull request, no worries. Go ahead and attach it to the issue. 


### Proposing something else?

If you‚Äôd like to contribute something else that doesn‚Äôt fall into any of the above, we‚Äôd still love to hear about it. Just create an issue or a discussion, and we can talk about it.  

## How we prioritize

Once you‚Äôve submitted a contribution, we'll triage it based on the following considerations:
1. **Size:** Can we accomplish this in a sprint or will this take longer? 
2. **Severity:** What type of functionality is impacted? Is there a workaround?
3. **Priority:** Does this align with our vision and roadmap goals? 

Note: We prioritize issues that affect accessibility. 

These considerations help us decide if and when we can work on the issue. If the issue is accepted, we will schedule them for an upcoming sprint (a 2-week work period).

You can stay up to date on the status of your contributions through [GitHub email notifications](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/setting-up-notifications/configuring-notifications) (external link) and the assigned labels on the issue. 

## Common terms

There can be a lot of jargon when discussing how you can contribute to the Design System. We‚Äôve included some common terms we use below.

- **Backlog** - list of deliverables (like a feature request, enhancement, or bug) that should be implemented into upcoming product development. 
- **Bug** - problem resulting in something not working properly or as expected.

- **Open source** - something that can be viewed, modified, and shared by anyone in the public with permissions enforced through an open source license.
- **Pull request** - a way to notify project team members when a contributor/developer wants to merge new code changes into a main project repository. You can read more on [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) (external link).
- **Repository (aka repo)** - In Github, a repository contains all your projects‚Äô files and each of their revisions. You can read more on [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/about-repositories) (external link).
